# Ground Truth Validation

These are the nine questions that we asked developers to validate the Organic tool.

| Smell           | Question                                                                                                | Answer |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| God Class       | Does the class have more than one responsibility?                                                       | Yes    |
| God Class       | Does the class have functionality that would fit better into other classes?                             | Yes    |
| God Class       | Would splitting up the class improve the overall design?                                                | Yes    |
| Refused Bequest | Does the class use only a little of parentâ€™s behavior?                                                  | Yes    |
| Refused Bequest | Does the class have too many methods that overrides the parent behavior?                                | No     |
| Refused Bequest | Would refactoring the inheritance improve the overall design of this class?                             | Yes    |
| Spaghetti Code  | Is the class well-structured? For instance, would you be able to clearly state what the class is doing? | No     |
| Spaghetti Code  | Is the class difficult to maintain? For instance, are there many conditional branches in the code?      | Yes    |
| Spaghetti Code  | Are most of the methods from this class interacting with other objects?                                 | No     |

These are the options the developers could choose:

| Option     | Reasoning                                                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Yes        | If you are confident you can evaluate the class, and think the answer is yes.       |
| No         | If you are confident you can evaluate the class, and think the answer is no.        |
| Don't know | If you are not confident you can evaluate the class, and prefer not to answer.      |
| NA         | If you cannot answer the question because the question does not apply to the class. |
